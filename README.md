Use CSS interactions transitions to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example,
reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc).
When clicked, toggle a “selected” CSS class on the active icon and log a message to the
console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed
with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).

# My svg icons

My web is svg icon site is about the exploration of the universe, svg is about the planets and the universe theme.

I layered the layers of the icon using AI. So that when the user clicks on the icons, it changes to different colors. I also used".selected" command to change the color by clicking on the box.

I also use js., when we clicked  icons, it will console!

Thanks !
Have a good week!
